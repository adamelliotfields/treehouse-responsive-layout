## About

The second unit demonstrates using HTML and CSS to make a mobile-first, responsive web site from
scratch.

All CSS code is hand-written and the layout must match the mocks. CSS Grid is used for layout, with
some flexbox used as well.

The HTML and CSS code must pass W3C validation.

## Usage

You can view hosted site [here](https://adamelliotfields.github.io/treehouse-responsive-layout/index.html).

You can also simply open `index.html` in your browser directly. For example, if your macOS user name
is `adam` and you cloned the repo in `~/Downloads`, then go to
`file:///Users/adam/Downloads/treehouse-responsive-layout/index.html` in your web browser.

You can also use PHP or Python's built-in HTTP server by running one of these commands in the same
directory as `index.html`.

```bash
# PHP
php -S localhost:8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# Python 3
python3 -m http.server
```

## Live Reloading

If you have Node.js and NPM installed, you can use [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io) to start a
live reload server.

```bash
npm i -g browser-sync

# Run this in the same directory as index.html
browser-sync . -w
```

## Validating HTML and CSS

Use the [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and
[W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) validators by pasting the code
into the text input.
