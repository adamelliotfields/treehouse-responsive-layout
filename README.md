## About

The second unit demonstrates using HTML and CSS to make a mobile-first, responsive web site from
scratch.

All CSS code is hand-written and the layout must match the mocks. A Bootstrap-like grid is used to
achieve the responsive layout by setting `flex-basis` and `max-width` to a percentage of the
viewport using `min-width` media queries.

The HTML and CSS code must pass W3C validation.

## Usage

You can view hosted site [here](https://adamelliotfields.github.io/treehouse-responsive-layout/index.html).

You can also simply open `index.html` in your browser directly. For example, if your macOS user name
is `adam` and you cloned the repo in `~/Downloads`, then go to
<file:///Users/adam/Downloads/treehouse-responsive-layout/index.html> in your web browser.

You can also use PHP or Python's built-in HTTP server by running one of these commands in the same
directory as `index.html`.

```bash
# PHP
php -S localhost:8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# Python 3
python3 -m http.server
```

## Validating HTML and CSS

Use the [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and
[W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) validators by pasting the code
into the text input.

## Browser Compatibility

The CSS has been vendor prefixed using [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io) using the
[defaults](https://browsersl.ist/?q=defaults) browsers list.
